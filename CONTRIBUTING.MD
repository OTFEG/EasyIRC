## Code requirements
* We prefer to follow the [Oracle coding standards](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html).
* No tabs; use 4 spaces instead.
* No trailing whitespaces.
* No 80-column limit (or 'weird' midstatement newlines) (**within reason**: If your line is more than 80 characters long, chances are you've done something wrong).
* Any major additions should have documentation ready and provided if applicable.
